<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; padding-bottom: 2rem; align-items: center;">
    <h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">Increment 4 - Shopping list</h1>

    <ol style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        <li>The ingredients format is changed:
            <ol>
                <li>The amount is now a floating point number</li>
                <li>The unit of measure is now a text
                </li>
                <li>The ingredient name is still a text</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>A shopping list can be exported ad-hoc:
            <ol>
                <li>A shopping list request contains (references to) menus and/or recipes</li>
                <li>A shopping list must reference at least one menu or recipe</li>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">Ingredient amounts are rounded to two decimals - trailing zeroes are
                    removed (so "2.0 pc eggs"
                    becomes "2 pc eggs", but "0.33 l milk" stays as "0.33 l milk"</li>
                <li style="font-weight: bold;">A shopping list adds ingredients with the same name and unit of measure
                    automatically, so "2.0 pc
                    eggs" and "3.0 pc eggs" get exported as "5 pc eggs"</li>
                <!-- <li>The export contains the added amounts, units of measures and names of all ingredients</li> -->
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
