    <ol style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
        <li>Menus can be created:
            <ol>
                <li>Menus have a title: Required, text, 120 characters max</li>
                <li>A menu belongs to exactly one user</li>
                <li>Menus reference at least one recipe of the same user they belong to</li>
                <li>The order in which recipes are referenced in the menu is important</li>
                <li>If a recipe gets deleted, it is automatically removed from all menus</li>
                <li>If a menu contains no more recipes it gets deleted</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <!--
        <li>Recipes and menus can be exported:
            <ol>
                <li>An exported recipe includes its title, method and ingredients, and to how many menus it belongs</li>
                <li>If the recipe has an image URL output the URL as text, too</li>
                <li>An exported menu includes its title and the exports of all recipes it references, in order</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The export format is not important - plain text is fine</li>
        -->
    </ol>
